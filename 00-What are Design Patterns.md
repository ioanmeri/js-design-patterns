# What are Design Patterns?

Wikipedia Defenition: Software Design Pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Design Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design Pattern are:

* **general**
  * can be applied to multiple aspects of your software design, even if you are designing a game, a website, a mobile application. Applicable to any form of application you are creating.
* **reusable**
  * use the same pattern, you only need to learn the pattern once to use it across your application
* **formalization of best practices**
  * a formal written way in order to solve a problem in the cleanest way possible

Make your code less buggy and error-prone.

**Don't overkill** using design pattern though, when you don't really need them, might make your code messier.

## How to use them
This is a hard thing. Sometimes it is overkill but knowing these design patterns is important because it allows you to have a holistic view of how to **create cleaner**, **more reusable code** rather than throwing something together that works.

It leads to create more and more clean code and wanting to learn about different ways to architect code, which will make your applications easier and quicker to maintain in the long run as you go forward adding new features.
